# Conformal Mean Curvature Flow Solitons
=====

Project for exploring Conformal Mean Curvture Flow solitons. These are solutions of the Mean Curvature Flow that are moving along the integral curves of a conformal vector field. Homothetic and translating solitons in Eucidean space are examples of such solitons.
